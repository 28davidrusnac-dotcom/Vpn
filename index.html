    <p>
1. Application Layer
Encrypts all your data before it leaves your device.

2 .Transport Layer:
It takes encrypted data and sends it through an encrypted network, which makes it harder for hackers to intercept your connection

3. Internet Layer
It replaces your IP address with one from a NovaVPN server.

4. Network access
This is where a physical connection happens. NovaVpn doesn't change the connection physically; it just wraps your data in an encrypted tunnel. Even if a hacker were to intercept the connection, all they would see is encrypted noise.
