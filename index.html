        <h7>Hyperspeed Encryption</h7>

        <p>NOVA VPN uses a proprietary encryption protocol, developed from the ground up by Wyatt and David, that provides unparalleled speed and security. Our technique leverages quantum-inspired randomness and multi-phase key rotation, making your data not only unreadable to prying eyes, but also virtually impossible to intercept.
</p>

        <h6>What is a VPN?</h6>

        <p>A VPN, or a Virtual Private Network, is a service that creates an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic. It protects your data, secures your connection, and masks your IP address, ensuring no hackers will be able to intercept your internet presence.
How NOVA interacts with All Four Layers of the Internet</p>

1. Application Layer
Encrypts all your data before it leaves your device.

2 .Transport Layer:
It takes encrypted data and sends it through an encrypted network, which makes it harder for hackers to intercept your connection

3. Internet Layer
It replaces your IP address with one from a NovaVPN server.

4. Network access
This is where a physical connection happens. NovaVpn doesn't change the connection physically; it just wraps your data in an encrypted tunnel. Even if a hacker were to intercept the connection, all they would see is encrypted noise.
